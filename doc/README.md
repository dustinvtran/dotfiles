# A (revitalized) philosophy of a workflow

I used to be about a fully customized and personalized workflow in
order to efficiency. However, because of frequent collaboration I'm
now the opposite and prefer defaults.

+ more desktop app integration: use desktop apps over web apps if they have a
  particular advantage such as speed, desktop notifications, etc.
+ more use of built-in shortcuts: stick with built-in shortcuts unless your
  customization drastically increases productivity, e.g., s/t to move prev/next
  tab in firefox
+ ability to go from all gui to all hacker terminal
  + preferably a nice gui aesthetic like hdni with power commands
+ stick with app launcher/focuser for most things, only keybind things you need
  instant access to, such as browser, todolist, and vim, but not e.g., spotlight
+ keep lots of stuff minimized, e.g., calendar, wunderlist, spotify
+ allow other users to easily access, understand, and use primary apps (general
  desktop movement, browser)
+ some easy combination of both all gui and all themed/customized cli apps
+ On browsers: modal editing just does not work here. Some pages work
  best under their own controls, so it makes no sense to have an
  overarching normal mode where you do browser navigation, and then
  you have to go to insert mode to work on the page, e.g., mail, or
  even simple things such as text input from google instant search.
  This requires the emacs approach of purely modifiers, and use only
  keys that no other app would.

examples of moves from customizability extreme to defaults

+ colemak -> qwerty
+ firefox with modal editing, custom styles, etc. -> safari
